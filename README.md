## WELCOME HelpMakeVideo
It's a small project that will be improved.
I was working on it 1 month. Main idea is to make an app that runs on browser and helps people to make some basic video really fast. I reccomend you to use high quality images* to achive decent look.
It was longer that I've expected. 
It has
- ZOOM IN and OUT with text.
- Left side IMAGE and right side text 
(upto 4 rows, because 5 is too much for one info image)
- Drawing with hand and without. You can make similar to those infographics videos.
- ANIMATION FOR TEXT : one after another and typing

# Technology Stack
plain js and html canvas

# Roadmap

Now I have new ideas that will implement in next weeks. 
- free mode
- maybe svg
